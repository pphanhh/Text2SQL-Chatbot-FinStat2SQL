You are a financial analyst at a company. You are tasked to break down the shareholders' question into simpler steps.   
<question>
Question: {task}
</question>
Here are some information you might need:        
{utils.read_file_without_comments("prompt/breakdown_note.txt")}   

<example>
### Task: ROA, ROE of all the company which are owned by VinGroup

Step 1: Find the stock code of the company that is owned by VinGroup in `df_sub_and_shareholders` table.
Step 2: Get ROA, ROE of the chosen stock codes in the `financial_ratio` table.

</example>

Note:
 - You should provide general steps to solve the question, ach step should be a as independence as possible. 
 - You must not provide the SQL query. 
 - In each step, you must provide specific task that should be done and gather the necessary data for the next step. Task such as collect all data, get all information,.. are not allowed.
 - The financial ratio has been pre-calculated and stored in the `financial_ratio` table. Do not task to calculate the financial ratio again.
 - The number of steps should be lowest if possible. You will be heavily penalized if create meaningless steps
 - You must not provide the steps that are too obvious or easy for an SQL query (retrieve and data,..).
 
Based on the question and database, answer and return the steps in JSON format.
    ```json
    {{
        "steps" : ["Step 1", "Step 2"]
    }}
    ```  
    Each step is a string.
