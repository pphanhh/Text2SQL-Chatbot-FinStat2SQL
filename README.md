# Text2SQL-Chatbot-FinStat2SQL
FinStat2SQL is a financial Text2SQL chatbot designed to bridge accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy gaps in financial data analysis. It leverages a custom-built financial database of Vietnamese corporations, banks, and securities firms, with a multi-agent framework for entity extraction, SQL generation, and self-correction.

This is an on-going research project conducted by a group of two, nearing completion. As it has not yet been published, the dataset and detailed techniques cannot be shared at this time.
